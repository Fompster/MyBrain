        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            This is my very first project in which I will document my learning journey on how to use Javascript. From this point I have no prior knowledge
             of it but in this project I will be primarily using canvases. So to start things off I will create something that I have wanted to do for 
             a very long time now. Bouncing balls!
        </p>
        
        <div class="demo">
            <canvas class="canvas-small" id="bounceBalls" width="600" height="400"></canvas>
            <button type="button"
                onclick="bouncingBallCanvases.push(new BounceBall(canvas1));">
                Click to start the demo
            </button>
        </div>
        <p>This was relitively easy to implement. Like many things there were multiple ways to make this trail. The way it's implemented now is that I save the 
            previous positions of the ball and draw them for each frame using a ratio to mentain the size and opacity. A different way is to clear the canvas 
            inbetween each frame with an opaque rectangle which is the same color as the background. The latter seems much better than the one I implemented, 
            especially for a demo with more than one ball. My reasoning for keeping it the way it is, is that I would like there to be a dark version for this 
            site at some point so I will have to define some background color that may change.
        </p>     
        <p>
            The trail which I have added to the end of the ball gave me an idea. These circles can make for some really fun particle effects.
        </p>

    <div class="dark-section" onload="sparks(canvas2);">
        <canvas class="expanded-canvas" id="canvas2"></canvas>

        <p>
            I wanted to make this demo slightly harder so I made it possible for the sparks to follow your mouse. The issues I faced with this is that 
            the given position of the mouse was relevant to the page and not the canvas I was drawing on, so I needed a bit of help from the internet 
            to figure how to solve that.
